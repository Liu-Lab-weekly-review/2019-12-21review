Paragraph writing practice
  Intact innervation is essential for normal fracture healing because nerve injury induced a large, but mechanically insufficient, fracture callus. In J E Madsen’s research, they used a stable fracture model to research on the effects of femoral and sciatic nerve resection on fracture healing and innervation of the fracture callus. Through their experiment, they finally conclude that intact innervation is essential for normal fracture healing. But as claimed as Jian Li,sensory neuropeptide involved in local bone turnover is known, but poorly understood. So they analyzed the occurrence of neuronal CGRP during healing and modeling of straight and angular tibial fractures in 74 rat, suggesting that fracture evokesan intense, localized in-growth of new nerve fibers containing CGRP, which may prove to be a prerequisite of fracture healing and modeling. Moreover Stefanie A. T. Mitchell’s paper described recent advances in understanding the mechanisms that drive fracture pain and how these findings are helping develop new therapies to treat fracture pain. And I think the most important information in this paper is that nerve growth factor are released by cells at the fracture site. These papers are useful I think for understanding of innervation of the fracture.
